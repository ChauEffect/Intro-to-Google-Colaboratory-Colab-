# Intro-to-Google-Colaboratory-Colab-
Google Colaboratory (or Colab) is an online notebook which is very simple to use. 
It is a bit like an online version of Jupyter Notebook.
This repository is a Colab Code snippet created using a YouTube video (URL: https://youtu.be/vVe648dJOdI ) as a guide, that introduces the use of Google Colab.
I created the code following the instructions in the You Tube video as I had never used Colab before.
